A Simple Teaching Framework for Distributed Reinforcement Learning
:::::: 

RLZero is a teaching framework for Distributed Reinforcement Learning.
It is a library of fundamental RL abstractions that enables prototyping RL research papers from scratch, quickly and effectively.
RLZero is designed to facilitate rapid and efficient scaling of research prototypes into robust distributed architectures,
and it makes it easy to create *modular* distributed RL systems consisting of components that are *flexible*, *reusable* and *fault-tolerant*.

RLZero is mostly based on the [Acme framework of DeepMind](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme), however it is not a library of RL algorithms.
It is a framework that grew out of the lab-component for a graduate-level course _7.824 Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems_.
Similar to the [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) library by Josh Achiam at OpenAI, RLZero is foremost an educational resource. 
We offer a small and lightweight set of thoughtfully chosen abstractions that makes it simple and intuitive for students and engineers
to create modular distributed RL systems. Although the framework is decoupled from the choice of
<!--#TODO  Abstraction name + links -->

- **RL simulation environment** (Gymnasium, Mujoco, PettingZoo, ...)
- **Deep Learning framework** (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, ...)
- **Distributed-computation framework** (Ray, Spark, Hadooop, ...)
- **Cloud infrastructure** (GCP, AWS, ...)
- **Experiment-Logging/MLOps platform** (WandDB, Tensorboard, MLFlow, ...)
- **Storage system (Experience Replay Buffer)** (Reverb, Redis, Python List[A], ...)

RLZero provides concrete implementations of all of these abstract components, using industry-standard tools,
making it simple to get started in RL research today.
