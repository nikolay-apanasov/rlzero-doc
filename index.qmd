RLZero Documentation
===============================================================================

RLZero is a library of building blocks for Reinforcement Learning, which enables prototyping RL research papers from scratch, quickly and effectively.
It is designed to facilitate rapid and efficient scaling of research prototypes into robust distributed architectures.
That is, RLZero makes it easy to create *modular* distributed RL systems consisting of components that are *flexible*, *reusable* and *fault-tolerant*.
The framework provides a set of fundamental RL abstractions that make it simple to quickly get the design of a new system architecture just right.

RLZero is mostly based on the [Acme framework of DeepMind](https://github.com/google-deepmind/acme), however it is not a library of RL algorithms.
It is the outgrowth of the lab-component for a graduate-level course _7.824 Deep Reinforcement Learning Systems_.
Similar to the [Spinning Up](https://spinningup.openai.com/) library by Josh Achiam at OpenAI, RLZero began as an educational resource for Reinforcement Learning.
We offer a small and lightweight set of thoughtfully chosen abstractions that makes it simple and intuitive for students and engineers
to create *modular* distributed RL systems. While the overall framework is decoupled from the choice of
<!--#TODO  Abstraction name + links -->

- RL simulation environment (Gymnasium, Mujoco, PettingZoo, ...)
- Deep Learning framework (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, ...)
- Distributed-computation framework (Ray, Spark, Hadooop, ...)
- Cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS, ...)
- Experiment-Logging/MLOps platform (WandDB, Tensorboard, MLFlow, ...)
- Storage system for experience replay buffers (Reverb, Redis, ...)

RLZero provides concrete implementations of all of these abstract components, using industry-standard tools,
making it simple to get started in RL research today.
